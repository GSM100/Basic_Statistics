Types of Data\n","\n","    -  Qualitative (Categorical) : Non-numeric, descriptive.\n","\n","    -  Example: Gender (Male/Female), Colors, Blood type.\n","\n","    -  Quantitative (Numerical): Numeric, measurable.\n","\n","     -  Example: Age, Income, Height, Weight.\n","\n"," Scales of Measurement :\n","\n","  -  Nominal: Categories without order (e.g., blood group).\n","\n","-  Ordinal: Ordered categories (e.g., survey rating: poor, good, excellent).\n","\n","- Interval: Numeric scale without true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).\n","\n","- Ratio: Numeric scale with true zero (e.g., height, weight, income).\n","\n","2. Measures of Central Tendency\n","\n","   -  Mean: Arithmetic average; used for symmetric distributions without outliers.\n","\n","   -  Median: Middle value; used when data is skewed or has outliers (e.g., income data).\n","\n","   -  Mode: Most frequent value; useful for categorical data (e.g., most common shoe size).\n","\n","3. Dispersion\n","\n","   -  Describes how spread out the data is.\n","\n","   -  Variance: Average of squared deviations from mean.\n","\n","    -  Standard Deviation (SD): Square root of variance; measures average spread in same units as data.\n","\n","-  Higher SD → more spread; lower SD → more consistency.\n","\n","4. Box Plot\n","\n","    -  Visual summary of data distribution using 5-number summary: min, Q1, median,    -  Q3, max.\n","\n","    -  Shows spread, skewness, and outliers.\n","\n","5. Random Sampling\n","\n","      -  Ensures each member of population has equal chance of being selected.\n","\n","      -  Helps make unbiased inferences about population.\n","\n","      -  Reduces selection bias and improves representativeness.\n","\n","6. Skewness\n","\n","    - Measure of asymmetry in data distribution.\n","\n","    -  Positive skew (right-skewed): Tail on right, mean > median. Example: income.\n","\n","     -  Negative skew (left-skewed): Tail on left, mean < median. Example: age at death in elderly population.\n","\n","     -    Interpretation: Skewness affects which central tendency measure is more reliable.\n","\n","7. Interquartile Range (IQR)\n","\n","    - IQR = Q3 – Q1 (middle 50% of data).\n","\n","   - Used to detect outliers:\n","\n","   - Outlier if < Q1 – 1.5×IQR or > Q3 + 1.5×IQR.\n","\n","\n","\n","8. Binomial Distribution Conditions\n","\n","     - Fixed number of trials (n).\n","\n","      -   Each trial has 2 possible outcomes (success/failure).\n","\n","      - Probability of success (p) is constant.\n","\n","      - Trials are independent.\n","\n","      - Example: Flipping a coin 10 times, number of heads.\n","\n","\n","\n","9. Normal Distribution & Empirical Rule\n","\n","     - Symmetric, bell-shaped distribution.\n","\n","     - Properties: mean = median = mode, total area = 1.\n","\n","     - Empirical Rule:\n","\n","     - 68% data within 1 SD\n","\n","     - 95% within 2 SDs\n","\n","     - 99.7% within 3 SDs\n","\n","\n","10. Poisson Process Example\n","\n","- Models number of events in a fixed time/space with constant average rate.\n","\n","- Example: Number of emails per hour.\n","\n","- If average λ = 4 emails/hour, probability of exactly 6 emails:\n","\n","\n","\t​\n","\n","11. Random Variables\n","\n","-  Random Variable: Function that assigns numerical values to outcomes of a random experiment.\n","\n","- Discrete: Countable outcomes (e.g., number of heads in coin flips).\n","\n","- Continuous: Infinite outcomes (e.g., height, weight).\n","\n","12. Covariance & Correlation Example\n","\n","- Dataset: Students’ hours studied (X) vs. exam score (Y).\n","\n","- Covariance: Measures direction of relationship (positive/negative).\n","\n","- Correlation: Standardized measure (–1 to +1) showing strength of relationship.\n","\n","- +1 → perfect positive linear relation\n","\n","- –1 → perfect negative linear relation\n","\n","-  0 → no linear relation"],"metadata":{"id":"rPoAyIdjPdU8"}}]}
